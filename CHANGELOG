--------------------------------------------
win32:
    better searching for Platform SDK path (Ren� M�ller)
    proper Py_{BEGIN,END}_ALLOW_THREADS (Ren� M�ller)

    added experimental Broadcom/Widcomm support.  All the basics should be
    supported:
        RFCOMM sockets
        L2CAP sockets
        Device Discovery, Name Lookup
        SDP search on remote devices
        SDP advertisement (RFCOMM, L2CAP)

    Widcomm stack notes:
        1. BluetoothSocket.accept () always returns 0 for the port,
           as the RFCOMM channel/L2CAP PSM of the client device is not exposed
           by the Widcomm API
        2. Not all fields of advertise_service are supported.  The following
           parameters are currently not supported:
               description, protocols
        3. The following methods of BluetoothSocket are not supported:
              gettimeout, dup, makefile, settimeout
        4. The following parameters to discover_devices are not supported:
               duration, flush_cache (cache always flushes)
        5. The timeout parameter of lookup_name is not supported
        6. Once a listening socket has accepted a connection, it is not put
           back into listening mode.  The original listening socket essentially
           becomes useless.
        7. SDP search/browse operations on the local host are not yet supported

GNU/Linux:
    fix segfault on trying to SDP advertise when sdpd not running
        (reported by Eric Butler)

                               not at all on others)
  advertise_service() fully supported


changes from 0.6.1 to 0.7 (May 5, 2006)
---------------------------------------
